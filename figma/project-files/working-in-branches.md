# Working In Branches

Project files vary but this guide aims to cover the best practices to create a consistent approach for the wider team working across these files.

## Branching

[Branching](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) is a fantastic way to enable multiple strands of exploration simultaneously with the ability to then merge back into the primary master branch as a reference point. This simple guide is meant to help you understand our approach to this and keeping yourself right.

Adding comments and suggestions to live components, annotations files of project files can add confusion. *We should never add comments to these live files*. These files are used as points of reference by the wider digital team and additional comments can lead to confusion.

### When should you branch?

Best advice is that all active work should be in a branch, small change or big, create a branch with the view to get it merged back in as quickly as possible. You can happily juggle many branches at once but try to ensure they don’t linger too long. 

Avoid having multiple work strands in a single branch, it makes understanding what’s in the file complex and difficult for people to navigate.

### Use cases

Below are some of the possible use cases for branches:

- Working on a new project based on a master file

- Suggesting a bug fix to a file or component

- Ideating on a piece of work or a component

- Creating a leaner file, such as a prototype, from a larger master file

### Merging back in? How and when.

In an ideal world work would be merged back in when it’s live and available to our customers. However, design work can often be completed ahead of time or even feature multiple rounds of refinement. The best advice is to [correctly utilise our emoji system]() inside our files to show where things are at in terms of exploration vs published and try merge content as soon as you believe it to be in a consumable fashion.

Let’s play out an example that might help illustrate this.

> Jane Doe is working on a new modal to announce a feature being added to the application. The design has been agreed and all the screens are in place but there’s some back and forth on copy and illustration work that may need tweaked. It’s agreed that this can wait right now as development has been pushed back to next quarter for unrelated reasons.

Rather than leaving the branch open and coming back to it later Jane should tidy up the work and save a version history point and ensure the emoji state still marks it as exploration until published. This work should then be merged before moving onto anything else.

This example shows how to think about when it’s best to merge and branch again later to complete work keeping things nice and tidy for all.

## Sharing Branches

When you branch is in a state you are happy to share with the team either add it to the [#team-ux-show-and-share](https://phoenixgroupplc.slack.com/archives/C0391SQ0NS3) slack channel or the next available UX review.

If sharing on Slack, it helps to provide context on the change with some additional notes.

- What was the issue that you identified?

- What have you changed?

- What feedback are you looking for?

## Make sure it’s peer reviewed.

OK, you’ve decided you’re wanting to merge a branch back in. How do you go about it? [Figma’s documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063144053-Create-branches-and-merge-changes) covers the practical aspects but it’s equally important we follow our peer review process to maintain good standards of quality. The peer review process is relatively simple, no work can be merged back in without having been given the thumbs up by *at least two other UX designers*.

The review process isn’t there to question design decisions unless they contradict standard component usage and conventions. Rather it’s a means of ensuring people are working consistently. To make your life easier we have a [checklist available]() and more information on file reviews in general.

## Comments & Merging

Like all other Figma files, we can share our responses through comments. Remember to follow our guides on [how to check files]() and [provide useful feedback]().

Like all branches you should request a review from *at least two other team members* before it is merged into master. If the changes are to a component, the documentation should also be updated inline with the update.
