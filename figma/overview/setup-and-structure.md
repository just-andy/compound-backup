# Setup & Structure

The workspace for Phoenix Group in Figma terminology is an organisation, below this there are teams, projects and files.Projects and files are set up into different groupings depending on their structure.

---

## File types

Figma has two types of files: Design and Figjam.

These files can be grouped and organised within Figma teams using projects, which act like a folder in a file system.

## Teams

Teams are based on the business function either a brand, component library or explorations. Within each team are projects.

## Projects

Each brand team is set up roughly the same:

- *FigJam* Collaboration files for this team.

- *Project Files* - Projects are grouped logically based on the teams needs. Projects will contain files specific to a task. The example below illustrates the projects within the Standard Life team.

- *Sketch Archive* - This should be used for reference only.


Projects can be set up to only invite certain members, if you can’t find a project it is worth [checking you have access.]()

## Files & Pages

Files are the core of where the work is carried out and clearly labelling pages in a structured way makes them easy to navigate.

Aside from Cover and Graveyard, you may have multiple pages of the same type.

### *Project Team Files*

- 📘 *Cover* - Cover file contains the project thumbnail.

- 🚀 *Exploration -* Indicates that these are only at idea stage. In some instances you may opt to make this a branch.

- 🕹 *Prototype* - Indicates a page contains a prototype. In some instances you may opt to make this a branch.

- 🚦 *In Review -* Displays that files are under review by stakeholders.

- 📐 *Annotations -* Files specific for development reference. It’s good practice to include the Jira ticket name in the page title e.g. 📐 Jira-PG123 Annotations.

- 💾 *Published* - Designs that have been built and published to a live site/app.

- 🔬 *Research* - Supporting notes and exploration can be contained here. [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/) should be used as much as possible for capturing research.

- ☠️ *Graveyard* - When files are no longer needed they can be moved to this page should they need to be referenced later.

### *Component Files*

- *Overview* - Cover file contains the project thumbnail.

- *Platform* - If a component differs per platform there should be a page per platform; Web, iOS and Android. No icon needed, this page should ALWAYS match the file name to reduce hierarchy in the asset naming.

- *Test Suite* - Instances laid out to quickly test changes to master files

- *Compositions -* Drag and drop layouts using the parent component
