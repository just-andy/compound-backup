## *Project File Checklist*

### General

- Make sure that the Figma file has been set up following the [setup and structure ]()guidelines.

- Unless specified are the designs following our [mobile first approach?]()

- Make sure that Compound components are being used as much as possible, custom components should be limited.

- Ensure styles and system colours have been used, custom values should only be for specific cases.

- Check that components have been laid out following our 8px soft grid.

### Cleanup

- Make sure layer and frames are correctly named, see the [Guides for Designers]()

- Check any previous comments have all been completed, marked as resolved or deleted. *There should be no remaining comments in a file when it is being merged back into the production version.*

- Before a review make sure that the version has used the correct 🚦 status indicator.

- *Don't forget the cover* - Ensure the cover component has been added and has a thumbnail set and all relevant content is correct.

- Remove any extra files, dummy instances etc that have cluttered up the document. Move items to ☠️  Graveyard or 🚀 Exploration if required.
