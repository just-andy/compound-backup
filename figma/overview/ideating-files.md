# Ideating Files

It is in our nature of our team to collaborate by working together and sharing ideas and perspectives. As a distributed team Figma gives us the power of branching to make edits away from live files.

## Using Branches

Adding comments and suggestions to live components, annotations files of project files can add confusion. *We should never add comments to these live files*. These files are used as points of reference by the wider digital team and additional comments can lead to confusion.

Figma branches offer the opportunity to make more proactive suggestions to a file. It provides the ability to work straight into the file to get your ideas and suggestions across.

For bug fixes it is helpful if your suggestions [follow our guidelines](https://www.notion.so/File-Reviews-aa9875d14e7d4c9bb0fc6058eafa79c0) and ready for a review before sharing. This means they can be reviewed and merged to master quickly.

### Use cases

Below are some of the possible use cases for branches:

- Working on a new project based on a master file

- Suggesting a bug fix to a file or component

- Ideating on a piece of work or a component

- Creating a leaner file, such as a prototype, from a larger master file

## Sharing Branches

When you branch is in a state you are happy to share with the team either add it to the [#team-ux-show-and-share](https://phoenixgroupplc.slack.com/archives/C0391SQ0NS3) slack channel or the next available UX review.

If sharing on Slack, it helps to provide context on the change with some additional notes.

- What was the issue that you identified?

- What have you changed?

- What feedback are you looking for?

## Comments & Merging

Like all other Figma files, we can share our responses through comments. Remember to follow our guides on [how to check files]() and [provide useful feedback](https://www.notion.so/feedback-4e52389462ea4a198eae5d80b1b40b8f).

Like all branches you should request a review from *at least two other team members* before it is merged into master. If the changes are to a component, the documentation should also be updated inline with the update.
