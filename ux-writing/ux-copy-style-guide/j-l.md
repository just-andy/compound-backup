## labels

## life assurance

Lower case – no need to capitalise.

## lifestyle profile

## link text

When we’re linking off to a page or document, we should use clear, descriptive language and provide more information on where the link will take the user.

For example, if we’re linking to a savings and investment guide, we may say something like ‘Find out more in our savings and investments guide.’

## login and log in

A user would go to the login screen (noun) to log in (verb) to their online account.

So when we’re asking a user to ‘log in’ to something, it should always be two words.

## long-term or long term

We would talk about a long-term investment (hyphenated) but investing for the long term (no hyphen).
