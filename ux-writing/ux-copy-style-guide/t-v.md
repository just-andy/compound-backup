# T

## T&Cs

Acronym for terms and conditions. If we ever use this term, there’s no need to explain what T&Cs stand for.

## Tailored Investment Bond

When we’re talking about our product, it’s always capitalised. If we’re talking generally about tailored investment bonds, there’s no need to capitalise it.

## take-home pay

Not take home pay or take-home-pay

## taxpayer

Not tax payer or tax-payer.

## tax credits

Lower case and plural.

## tax-efficient

Tax-efficient is hyphenated – but ‘tax efficiency’ and ‘tax efficiently’ isn’t.

## tax-free

You could take your ‘tax-free cash’ or get a ‘tax-free lump sum’ (hyphenated) – but some of your pension is tax free (no hyphen).

## The Pensions Regulator

The ‘the’ in The Pensions Regulator is officially part of the name so should always be capitalised alongside Pensions and Regulator.

## till

Can be used as an alternative to until. Not til or ‘til.

## times

Use the 12-hour clock, followed by am or pm (for example, 2.15pm not 14:15).

Put a full stop between the hour and minutes (not a colon) and don’t put a space between the numbers and am or pm.

## top up

Not top-up.

## turnover

Not turn over or turn-over

# U

## UK

No need to write out the United Kingdom in full. If Northern Ireland isn’t included, say Britain or Great Britain instead – and ideally make it clear that Northern Ireland isn’t included.

## UK English

Of course, as a UK company, we use UK English rather than US English.

## up to date

The style guide is up to date (no hyphens) but it’s an up-to-date style guide (hyphenated).

## username

Not user name or user-name.

# V

## VAT

Always capitalised. No need to explain what VAT stands for.
