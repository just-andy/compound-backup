# Overview

Overlays are components which sit at levels higher than the page content and display a dialoge box of focused content.

They exist to focus the user into something related to the page or process they are working on within the context of that page.

## Key Points

- Overlays are displayed over the top of all other content as they are displayed at the [highest level]()

- The background overlay blocks out interaction with any content below unless it is dismissed

- Modals have restricted usage whereas an overlay dialogue can contain custom content at various sizes

## Usage

Both components in this family should be used when a secondary content or information is required to be displayed in relation to a page or process. When displayed these components focus the user on additional information or a requesting a decision, until they manually dismiss the component.

Both of these components should be triggered by a user tapping on a control so they are aware of the context of the launching screen.
