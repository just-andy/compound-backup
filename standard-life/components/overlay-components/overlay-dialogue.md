# Overlay Dialogue

---

## Key Points

- Overlays have a number of sizes that can be used to suit the content they are displaying

- Overlays can contain more custom content than [modals]()

- They share the same patterns to display and hide as modals

- Like modals the background layer blocks on the [levels below]() to focus the users attention

## Usage

Overlays allow for further secondary content within the context of a that it relates to to. This secondary content could be legal documentation, further information or analysis.

Unlike a [modal]() this content can be:

- Custom content

- Be displayed at various sizes in relation to the viewport

- Contain content that is vertically scrollable
