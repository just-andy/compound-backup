Star Ratings should be used inside of forms where you wish to capture a users feedback on a topic.

They should always be used with a clear label that proposes a question e.g. How would you rate this product?

## Behaviour

Users can use either their keyboard or cusor to change their selections. Hovering the cursor selects the rating in half step increments. Clicking the correct icon and increment will confirm the selection.

On the keyboard, with the focus set on the field a user can use their left and right arrow keys to make a selection. Enter or tab out confirms the selection.
