# Component Contribution

Add or upgrade our component library by following the component contribution process.

## Compound Component Criteria

A components value is its reuse and removes as the effort in creation and maintenance. Compound has a number of levels of component libraries but they fit the same basic criteria.

> Some extra info:  
> Does this project benefit more than one project team?

☑️  If it does, then it should be progressed through as a component proposal.

❌  If it doesn’t it should remain as a component local to your projects.

## Component Pre-Check

Components are products in themselves and they require the same high-level thought process as other any other product design, as they require effort in creation and on going maintenance.

Before creating a component it is worth running through this checklist.

- Can the same outcome be achieved using existing components?

- Will this component or update benefit the wider design system, or is it specific to my project?

- Which other teams would this benefit, have I reached out to them to discuss their needs?

## Building Components

### Component Design Ideation

When proposing a new component or component update it is best to start with visual designs. Working through variations, like those needed in an annotations, really help foster discussion around edge cases.

*Collaboration*

It is beneficial to take these concepts to a review with team mates to check for crossover or alignment. Remember, components should benefit more than one team.

*Work in Boundaries*

Although tempting to think too far it is a better practice to work out what component(s) are required for immediate work. Using this as a baseline you can work through the variations that will be changing using just those properties i.e. toggling images or buttons.

Remember, components can be improved and ideated and the first release does not have to be the final answer.

## Preparing a Component Proposal

A proposal is the first step to moving things forward. The proposal doesn’t have to be the final design, that is is for specification & annotation.

The proposal should be a high level summary that is shared to the [Team UX channel](https://phoenixgroupplc.slack.com/archives/C038B1E4LLB) for wider discussion and feedback.

Despite working through the design ideations with colleagues, 99% of the time the viewpoint of a developer or Product owner will highlight other requirements.

What should be in the proposal:

1. A brief summary of what you are proposing to create or update.

1. Figma File of ideas and research

1. Why this can’t be achieved with existing work

1. An example to support your proposal; this can be a mockup, example from another system or site. [Codepen.io](http://Codepen.io) , [DesignSystem.io](https://design-systems.io/) and [DesignSystemRepo](https://www.notion.so/Component-Contribution-c03e1cc6ee9f4fb7af1eabcafcd6856c) are some good resources

1. Highlight what needs it fits for you and the other team(s) you have discussed it with

## Proposal Ideation Files

Getting feedback from the wider team on your thoughts an idea is a great way to collaborate and build a solid proposal. As this an ideation these files should be created in *Compound > Proposals* project so it is clear that they are at the ideation phase.

Create a new Figma or FigJam file within this project with a clear title of component/or update.

## Creating a specification

Following your proposal and discussion with the wider team it is likely that an agreed scope of work is required along with initial needs.

This should be moved forward into a more detailed specification that can be used by the product teams to build and and deliver.

The specification should include:

- *Specification Document* - Building on your proposal this should be a refined guide on what you hope to build. This is likely to be captured in a Jira ticket as a central source for the development teams

- *Figma Annotation* - Using the [template and guidelines]() create a detailed annotation to support your specification

- *Component Documentation* - This will be ongoing as you work with developers to create a delivered component. By the time a component is ready for releasing, a document should be added or updated to match that component

### Figma Components

At the point, a component is ready to be released the corresponding Figma component should be created following our [guidelines]() and [checks](). This should be complementary to the Component Documentation and annotations.

## If a component isn’t required?

After sharing your proposal or initial ideas it may be that you only you have this requirement, and an existing solution doesn’t exist.

Your team can still and should create a component specific to your requirements. It may be a future project arises and this could serve as a starting point to ideate on.
