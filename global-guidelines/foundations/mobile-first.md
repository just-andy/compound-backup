# Mobile First

We design from small screen sizes outwards.

## Overview

Smartphone usage in the UK has increased exponentially across all ages groups in the last ten years. No more so than in the 55-64 and 65+ age range where usage has increased from 9% in 2012 for 55-64 and 3% for 65+ to an incredible 87% 2020 for 55-64 and 65% for 65+. This will only have increased more since then. In fact, many adults now only access the web on their mobile device with no access to larger screen devices.

## In practice?

What does this mean for us in practice? That it’s more important than ever to maintain a mobile first focus on the design of our customer experiences. Scaling up experiences is often much easier than the ruthless focus that’s required to create a simple, elegant experience that meets our customers needs.

## Guidelines

When approaching *any* piece of work, unless there’s a very specific reason for it to be targeting larger screens (e.g. a piece of work for the iPad) then it should be created using a mobile viewport. Specially for us this is usually the size of the smallest (width wise) active iOS device. Right now that’s an *iPhone 13 Mini at a resolution of 375x812px*.

[Screensiz.es](https://www.screensizes.app/?compare=iphone) is a great resource for all resolution requirements. Once we have received a level of agreement on the work we can then start to look at fleshing out the larger screen variants but the priority should always be on mobile. This not only helps with a focus on the flows and experience but on clear and concise copy.

## Platforms

With there being so many platforms out there it can sometimes be confusing where to start, especially if you’re designing across many. Given our relative focus we would suggest starting on iOS and using that as a template for Mobile Web, Android, and then onto larger screens like iPad which can in turn influence Large Screen Web.

## Content First

Providing the optimal content to the user on each screen is key to a great user experience. Identify and prioritise the users primary goals, then provide secondary or tertiary needs as the user progresses down the screen.

### Identify the users goals

The following questions can help to refine page layouts and content:

- What are they looking for?

- Why do they need it?

- Where will they want to go next?

Identify your user's path and then make it as easy as possible for them to get there. If your user doesn't need it, it shouldn't be there.

## Designing For Mobile Quick Tips

- Mobile first should focus on supplying the key content the user needs at that time, so *focus on content requirements*. Additional information can clutter the screen and add confusion.

- *Consider navigation and hierarchy in your flows*. A user should be able to know where they are and traverse through a section or move up and down between parent and child pages.

- Any controls that require the user to touch them should have *enough whitespace around them to provide a clear hit state*. The guidelines between iOS and Android is *44px* and this can include the whitespace around the element.

- For mobile web, always remember that *the browser chrome will add additional elements on your viewport*. This decreases your overall size screen real estate.

- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) - Usability, page load, low data usage and perceived speed all come from creating designs that present the user with what they need at that time as easily as possible.
