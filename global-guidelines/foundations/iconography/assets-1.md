# Icon Sets

We currently have two icon sets with a separate range of icons. Our 24px icon set contains the largest range of icons and are used in most of our components such as buttons and lists.

The smaller 16px icon set is used mainly in specific situations or smaller component variants.

> Be warned:  
> Icons should not be created in other sizes or scaled to fit a specific need. These sets are created at a specific size to work with the 8px soft grid.
