## Overview

Across our platforms we use a mixture of photography and branded illustrations. These are nested in a number of components from graphics to cards.

## Media Libraries

Our latest media libraries are located in two separate locations:

- Brand Illustrations are in the [Figma Library File](https://www.figma.com/file/rAA7b2O8KpzzcvWCfu2B2Y/Brand-Illustrations).

- Photography files are located in a shared drive. 

If you are do not have access to either of these libraries please contact a member of the design team.

## Responsive Compositions

The requirements of creating media for different viewports can vary depending on your platform. Some platforms may require one file, whilst others would prefer one for each breakpoint. Discuss with your development team what their requirements are.

An example of breakpoint specific artwork can be seen on blog articles headers. This platform uses device specific illustrations or images to avoid cropping on different breakpoints.

Images are supplied at the following dimensions.

- *Desktop:* 1440x420px

- *Tablet landscape:* 1024x420px

- *Tablet portrait:* 768x420px

- *Mobile:* 375x300px

When supplying images for each breakpoint the images should use the following guidelines.

- Make sure that the focus of the composition will always be in view for each cropped size. Remember viewports can vary within a breakpoint range.

- Name files consistently but add the breakpoint size as a prefix e.g. “filename-example-large.jpg”.

### Composition and Aspect Ratio

When supplying images for your platform check the breakpoint width and then height required to display the content. With this information, the overall dimensions for each device can be calculated by maintaining the aspect ratio.

## Media In Handovers

When supplying images to the developers it is best practice to:

- Replace spaces with “-”

- Make sure file names are concise and named consistently.

- If possible, named in relation the content. This acts as a fallback for some accessibility tool if an alt tag does not exist.

- Images are outputted at as small a file size as possible. You can use the [TinyImage Compressor plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789009980664807964/TinyImage-Compressor) for extra control.

## Accessibility

Media should be [perceivable]() to all our users and therefore we make sure that all of our content is appropriately tagged and assets are sized to improve performance.
