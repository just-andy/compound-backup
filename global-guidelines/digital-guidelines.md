# Digital Guidelines

Our digital guidelines have a core set of principles which are covered in this Global Guidelines section. These guidelines cover the overall approach to all of our digital design across our brands. Each of our brand has a set of child guidelines, mainly focused on design token values.

## Using Our Guidelines

Our guidelines aim to serve all users, whether customing a whitelabel's properties or building an interface using our component library.

Our documentation is structured to scale and provide more detailed information as required. 

You should read through the base guidelines below and then the guidelines for the brand you are working with. Each of these deep link into specific pages should you require further more detailed information.

## Base Guidelines

### Layout & Structure

- All of our design solutions are mobile-first, whether it be web or native. This forces us to make sure that the designs is simple and the context is focused. We then work outward to our [larger breakpoints](). Even if an application has higher usage on a large screen we should always star from a smaller viewport

- We use the language of [small, medium, large and extra large viewports](), not mobile and desktop

- [We work to an 8px soft grid](). A soft grids define the spacing between elements rather than a strict document-wide grid

- [Layout grids]() can be used to help structure pages across breakpoints, these aren’t mandatory but can be used as a guideline

- The 8px soft grid should be used for any components inside a layout grid

- Brand logos should be placed in the top list and direct the user back to the application homepage when tapped

### Colour and Typography

- Each brand digitial guideline details the colour palettes and typography.

- All copy should confirm with [AA accessibility guidelines](), in most cases this is a body copy size of at least 16px and contrast ratio that meets the criteria

- We underline our text links to make sure they stand out from body copy

- Text links should be styled as per the brand guidelines for default, hover, active and visited states

- We are still working on our dark mode colour palettes. It has been defined but not implimented

### Buttons and Controls

- All of our controls that a user interacts with should meet the minimum tappable size of 44px

- Controls should use states to indicate to the user that an action has take place

- Our buttons component outlines how we use our suite of buttons individually or as a group

- These are outlined in each brand's component library and style block guidelines

### Components & Design System

- Our work is delivered both on web and native platforms. 

- We should aim for as much consistency in our system as possible but diverge where a platform has specific requirements

- *Compound* is open for contribution by any member of the digital team

- The key criteria are that any component request or update is [beneficial to more than one team]()

### Guidelines & Checklists

- We follow minimum [AA accessibility guidelines ]()and aim to reach a higher level of accessibility where possible

- We also consider our vulnerable customers when evaluating our designs

- We use[ Figma and FigJam]() as our design tools allowing us to design and collaborate in the open. We follow [structured guidelines]() on working in Figma to maintain consistency across our files

- We use [checklists]() on our Figma files to maintain consistency in the work across the team

- Regular attendance to design review and Compound catch-up sessions ensure governance across our system

### Other Key Points

- We have taken the time to detail [how to write consistently](). Our [UX copywriting style guide]() is detailed and continually updated

- We design with accessibility needs in mind, we won’t wait until development specifications to consider accessibility

- Our icon suite is custom to our platform and is available as 16px and 24px

- We are working towards all of our style definitions being aligned with the [W3C design token standard](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/) 

- As we are mobile first our digital applications should be performant as possible

## Future Vision

Currently, our digital estate is spread across a number of platforms and technical stacks. The future vision is that these will consolidate into a shared set of components with brand specific themes. We have structure this document to be allow for this approach and future scalability.
