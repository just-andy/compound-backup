# Contributing Docs

Content is king and centralising our documentation into one place empowers the team to create the same experiences across our products.

---

## *How to submit content*

The content on this site is a team effort and it is open to any contributions. The following information outlines how to prepare your content and assets for submission.

You should always request a review from the other member of the team before publishing.

## Writing Clear Docs

- Don’t assume the reader is an expert, but state clearly who the intended audience is.

- Open with a clear paragraph stating the documents purpose:
What do you hope to assist or inform with?
Are there any prerequisites i.e. “You should have access to Jira to follow along”?
Is this document aimed at a specific group or department?

- If it fits with the document use key points under the opening paragraph to highlight the key topics.

- Keep titles short, we also use titles as anchor links.

- Content should be be culturally neutral, e.g. don’t use “...piece of cake” or “Bob’s your uncle”.

- Keep content simple, don’t attempt to flex your knowledge.

- Any samples, particularly code, provided should match our standards and be functional.

- Use consistent terminology for the same things. An example of this is the [glossary for component documentation](https://www.notion.so/Components-Ignore-8943747d060e45dc93f4e23ba3f91235).

- When working with visuals, illustrations, example graphics and diagrams:
Don’t put more than one paragraph or subjects worth of information into the visual, keep it focused.
Add a caption to explain what the visual represents.

## Style Guide

- Use capital letters to when indicating the name of a component e.g. Icon Button.

- Keep paragraphs short and sweet. Break up items into bullet points if it is more concise.

- Use images where appropriate to support written content. Images should have example content, not Lorem Ipsum.

- Link to other docs or components if they are referenced.

- Bullet points should have full stops at the end.

- Numbers below ten should be written in full english i.e. *_two elements**_* not *_2 elements**_*.

- Technical documentation should be in the active voice, as it keeps sentence short and straight to the point.
Active Voice - “The player kicks the ball.”
Passive Voice - “The Football is kicked by the player.”
More examples: [Active v Passive Voice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/)

### Image *Assets*

- The max-width of *images should be 1024px*, height will scale proportionally. You can use the templates set up in this [Figma File for documentation assets](https://www.figma.com/file/FfZO9M5VBB9P60v6r2mqcU/?node-id=0%3A1).

- Images can be png or jpg depending on the user case.

- Video urls should be supplied as embed urls, files should be accessible by any member of Phoenix Group.

- Other file assets such as PDF's and MS docs can be attached, please make sure these are accessible by members of Phoenix Group.

- ALL ASSETS should be optimised to be as small as possible.

- ALL ASSETS should have the final names in lower case and use a "-" instead of spaces and underscores.

### Reviews and publishing

Just like our Figma components all content should have a review from at least two other members of the team. Supernova has the ability to save draft content. Share the draft content with the two reviewers so that edits and feedback can be made.

When those reviews have been completed then publish the documentation to live.
